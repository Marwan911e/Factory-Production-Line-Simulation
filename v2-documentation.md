# SimuLine: Factory Production Line Simulation
#
# This simulation models a factory with three machines in series, tracking:
# - Product flow through the manufacturing system
# - Machine states (idle, processing, failed, repaired)
# - Queue lengths and dynamics
# - Key performance indicators including waiting time, service time, and throughput metrics
#

    Each machine has a unique distribution to model real-world variability.

    Args:
        machine_id (str): Machine identifier (M1, M2, or M3)

    Returns:
        float: Processing time for the specified machine
    """
    if machine_id == "M1":
        # Normal distribution: more consistent processing times with some variation
        return np.random.normal(8, 1.5)
    elif machine_id == "M2":
        # Triangular distribution: min=6, mode=8, max=10
        return np.random.triangular(6, 8, 10)
    else:  # M3
        # Gamma distribution: more right-skewed for occasional longer processes

Before:

```
MACHINE METRICS:
| Machine | Products Processed | Utilization (%) | Availability (%) | Total Downtime | Number of Failures |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| M1      | 12                | 38.12          | 84.31           | 31.38          | 3                 |
...
```

After:

```
🏭 MACHINE METRICS
Performance statistics for each machine in the production line:
  • Products Processed: Total number of products that completed processing
  • Utilization (%): Percentage of time spent actively processing products
  • Availability (%): Percentage of time the machine was operational (not failed)
  • Total Downtime: Cumulative time the machine was in failed state
  • Number of Failures: How many times the machine broke down

| Machine | Products Processed | Utilization (%) | Availability (%) | Total Downtime | Number of Failures |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| M1      | 12                | 38.12          | 84.31           | 31.38          | 3                 |
...
```

#### 2.2 Added System Insights and Recommendations

The simulation now provides:

- Clear identification of bottlenecks
- Recommendations for improvements
- Analysis of waiting/processing time ratio
- Identification of queue problems

```
🔍 KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the simulation results, we can identify:
  • Bottleneck Machine: M2
    - This machine has the highest utilization and limits overall throughput
    - Consider adding capacity or improving this machine's performance
  • Most Failure-Prone Machine: M1
    - This machine fails most frequently, causing disruptions
    - Recommend implementing preventative maintenance
  • Average Waiting Time: 15.64 time units
  • Average Service Time: 22.87 time units
  • Waiting/Lead Time Ratio: 40.62%
    - 40.6% of time is non-value-adding waiting time
    - System has good flow efficiency
  • Longest Average Queue Time: M2 (8.35 time units)
    - This indicates a capacity mismatch between machines
```

#### 2.3 Added New Performance Metrics

Added two important new system-level metrics:

- `Throughput Rate`: Average number of products completed per time unit
- `System Efficiency`: Ratio of value-adding time to total lead time (%)
