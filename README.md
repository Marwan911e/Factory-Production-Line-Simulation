## üìã Factory System Overview

### The Production Line
Our simulation models a factory with a linear production line consisting of three machines (M1, M2, M3) arranged in sequence. Each product must pass through these machines in order:

```
[Products Enter] ‚Üí [Machine 1] ‚Üí [Machine 2] ‚Üí [Machine 3] ‚Üí [Products Exit]
```

### Key Characteristics of Our Factory

1. **Single-Product Flow**: Each machine can process only one product at a time.
2. **Sequential Processing**: Products must visit M1, then M2, then M3.
3. **Variable Processing Times**: Each machine takes a different amount of time to process products.
4. **Machine Failures**: Machines can break down randomly during operation.
5. **Repair Process**: When a machine breaks, it must be repaired before resuming operation.
6. **Queueing System**: Products wait in line when a machine is busy or broken.

### Machine Characteristics
- **Machine 1 (M1)**: Uses normal distribution for processing times (mean=8, std=1.5)
- **Machine 2 (M2)**: Uses triangular distribution for processing times (min=6, mode=8, max=10)
- **Machine 3 (M3)**: Uses gamma distribution for processing times (shape=2, scale=3)

### Factory Operating Rules
1. Products arrive according to an exponential distribution (mean=5 time units between arrivals)
2. Machines break down according to a Weibull distribution (shape=2, scale=20)
3. Repairs take a random amount of time following an exponential distribution (mean=10)
4. When a machine breaks while processing a product, the processing pauses until repair is complete
5. Products are processed in a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) manner

## üîÑ Simulation Flow Explained

The simulation progresses through these main stages:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialization
- Set up the simulation environment
- Create three machines (M1, M2, M3)
- Initialize data tracking variables for events, products, and machine states

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Product Generation
- Start generating products at random intervals
- Each new product enters the system and begins its journey through the machines

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Processing Flow
For each product:
1. **Arrival**: Product enters the system
2. **Queue at Machine 1**: Wait if M1 is busy
3. **Processing at Machine 1**: Product is processed by M1
4. **Queue at Machine 2**: Wait if M2 is busy
5. **Processing at Machine 2**: Product is processed by M2
6. **Queue at Machine 3**: Wait if M3 is busy
7. **Processing at Machine 3**: Product is processed by M3
8. **Completion**: Product exits the system

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Parallel Events
While products are flowing through the system:
- Machines occasionally break down randomly
- Broken machines get repaired after some time
- Products wait if their next machine is busy or broken
- Statistics are collected on waiting times, processing times, etc.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Simulation Completion
- Simulation runs until all products have completed processing
- Data is analyzed to calculate performance metrics
- Results are visualized in charts and tables
- A comprehensive HTML report is generated

## üíª Code Breakdown: Line-by-Line Explanations

### Imports and Setup

```python
import simpy               # Discrete-event simulation framework
import numpy as np         # For numerical operations and random distributions
import pandas as pd        # For data manipulation and analysis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For creating visualizations
import os                  # For file and directory operations
import datetime            # For timestamping reports
from tabulate import tabulate  # For creating text tables
import jinja2             # For HTML templating
import webbrowser         # For opening the report in a browser
```

### Probability Distributions

These functions generate random times based on statistical distributions:

```python
def interarrival_time():
    """Product arrivals: Exponential distribution (mean=5)"""
    return np.random.exponential(5)
    # Returns a random time between product arrivals.
    # Sometimes products arrive quickly after each other, sometimes with longer gaps.
    # The average time between arrivals is 5 time units.
```

```python
def processing_time(machine_id):
    """Different processing time distributions for each machine"""
    if machine_id == "M1":
        return np.random.normal(8, 1.5)  
        # M1 uses a normal (Gaussian) distribution
        # Mean processing time is 8 with standard deviation of 1.5
        # Most processing times will be between 5 and 11 time units
    elif machine_id == "M2":
        return np.random.triangular(6, 8, 10)  
        # M2 uses a triangular distribution
        # Minimum=6, Mode (most common)=8, Maximum=10
        # Processing times are always between 6 and 10, most commonly around 8
    else:
        return np.random.gamma(2, 3)  
        # M3 uses a gamma distribution with shape=2, scale=3
        # This gives a right-skewed distribution with mean=6
        # Occasionally will have longer processing times
```

```python
def failure_time():
    """Machine failures: Weibull distribution"""
    return np.random.weibull(2) * 20
    # Returns the time until a machine breaks down
    # Weibull distribution is commonly used to model equipment failures
    # Shape parameter=2 means failure rate increases with time (wear out)
    # Scale factor of 20 sets the characteristic life of the machine
```

```python
def repair_time():
    """Repair times: Exponential distribution (mean=10)"""
    return np.random.exponential(10)
    # Returns the time needed to repair a broken machine
    # Repairs follow an exponential distribution with mean=10
    # Most repairs are quick, but occasionally some take much longer
```

### Data Tracking Variables

```python
# Data tracking
event_log = []              # Record of all events that occur during simulation
product_metrics = []        # Detailed measurements for each product
machine_states = []         # Record of machine state changes (failure/repair)
interarrival_times = []     # Track time between arrivals
arrival_times = []          # Track when products arrive
active_products = 0         # Count of products currently in the system
```

### Machine Class

This class represents each machine in our factory:

```python
class Machine:
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        # Basic machine properties
        self.env = env                               # SimPy environment
        self.name = name                             # Machine name (M1, M2, M3)
        self.resource = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=1)  # Can process 1 product at a time
        self.broken = False                          # Starts in working condition
        self.total_downtime = 0                      # Time spent broken
        self.last_failure_time = 0                   # When the machine last broke
        self.utilization_time = 0                    # Time spent actively processing
        self.processing_count = 0                    # Number of products processed
        self.failures = 0                            # Number of breakdowns
        self.queue_length = 0                        # Current queue length
        
        # Queueing theory metrics
        self.total_waiting_time = 0       # Total time products waited in queue for this machine
        self.products_that_waited = 0     # Count of products that had to wait
        self.sum_queue_length = 0         # Sum of queue lengths over time (for calculating average)
        self.queue_length_samples = 0     # Number of times queue length was sampled
        self.total_service_time = 0       # Total time spent processing products
        self.total_idle_time = 0          # Total time machine was idle
        self.last_departure_time = 0      # Time when last product departed
        self.last_busy_state_change = 0   # Time of last change in busy status
        self.busy = False                 # Whether machine is currently busy
        
        # Start two background processes for this machine:
        env.process(self.break_machine())    # Process that handles random failures
        env.process(self.monitor_queue())    # Process that records queue statistics
```

The `break_machine` method simulates machines breaking down and being repaired:

```python
def break_machine(self):
    """Process that simulates random machine failures and repairs"""
    while True:
        # Wait for a random time until next failure
        yield self.env.timeout(failure_time())
        
        # Only break if machine is in use and not already broken
        if not self.broken and self.busy:
            self.broken = True                      # Mark as broken
            self.last_failure_time = self.env.now   # Record when it broke
            self.failures += 1                      # Increment failure counter
            
            # Log the failure event
            log(f"{self.name} FAILED", self.env.now)
            machine_states.append((self.env.now, self.name, "FAILED"))
            
            # Wait for repair time to complete
            yield self.env.timeout(repair_time())
            
            # Calculate how long it was broken and update statistics
            downtime = self.env.now - self.last_failure_time
            self.total_downtime += downtime
            
            # Log the repair event
            log(f"{self.name} REPAIRED", self.env.now)
            machine_states.append((self.env.now, self.name, "REPAIRED"))
            self.broken = False                     # Mark as repaired
```

The `monitor_queue` method collects statistics about the queue:

```python
def monitor_queue(self):
    """Process to monitor queue length over time"""
    while True:
        # Sample the queue length periodically
        self.sum_queue_length += len(self.resource.queue)  # Add current queue length to sum
        self.queue_length_samples += 1                     # Increment sample counter
        yield self.env.timeout(1)                          # Wait 1 time unit before next sample
```

The `update_busy_status` method tracks machine utilization:

```python
def update_busy_status(self, new_busy_state):
    """Update busy/idle status and calculate idle time"""
    current_time = self.env.now
    
    if self.busy and not new_busy_state:  
        # Machine is becoming idle
        self.busy = False
    elif not self.busy and new_busy_state:  
        # Machine is becoming busy
        # Add idle time from last state change until now
        self.total_idle_time += current_time - self.last_busy_state_change
        self.busy = True
    
    # Update timestamp of last state change
    self.last_busy_state_change = current_time
```

### Product Class

This class represents each product flowing through our factory:

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, env, name, machines):
        self.env = env                  # SimPy environment
        self.name = name                # Product name (e.g., "Product-7")
        self.machines = machines        # List of machines to visit [M1, M2, M3]
        self.start_time = env.now       # Time product entered the system
        self.end_time = None            # Will store time product exits system
        self.machine_times = {}         # Total time spent at each machine
        self.queue_times = {}           # Time waiting in queue for each machine
        self.processing_times = {}      # Actual processing time at each machine
        
        # Track number of products in system
        global active_products
        active_products += 1            # Increment count of active products
        
        # Record arrival time and calculate interarrival time
        if len(arrival_times) > 0:
            interarrival_times.append(self.start_time - arrival_times[-1])
        arrival_times.append(self.start_time)
        
        # Start the process of moving through machines
        env.process(self.process())
```

The `process` method handles the product's journey through the factory:

```python
def process(self):
    arrival_time = self.env.now
    log(f"{self.name} ARRIVED", self.env.now)  # Log arrival event

    # Visit each machine in sequence
    for machine in self.machines:
        queue_start = self.env.now       # Record time entering the queue
        machine.queue_length += 1        # Increment queue length counter

        # Request access to the machine and wait if it's busy
        with machine.resource.request() as request:
            # Update machine busy status
            machine.update_busy_status(True)  # Machine will be busy when we get it
            
            # Wait for the machine to be available
            yield request                # This pauses until we get the machine
            
            # Calculate time spent in queue
            queue_time = self.env.now - queue_start
            self.queue_times[machine.name] = queue_time
            machine.queue_length -= 1   # Decrement queue counter
            
            # Update queue statistics
            machine.total_waiting_time += queue_time
            if queue_time > 0:
                machine.products_that_waited += 1
            
            # Wait if machine is broken (keep checking until it's fixed)
            while machine.broken:
                log(f"{self.name} WAITING for {machine.name} repair", self.env.now)
                yield self.env.timeout(1)  # Wait 1 time unit, then check again
            
            # Start processing the product
            log(f"{self.name} START {machine.name}", self.env.now)

            # Update service time metrics
            machine.total_service_time += remaining_time
            
            # Process the product, accounting for possible machine failures
            while remaining_time > 0:
                if machine.broken:
                    # If machine breaks during processing, wait until it's fixed
                    log(f"{self.name} PAUSED {machine.name} due to failure", self.env.now)

                    yield self.env.timeout(step)
                    remaining_time -= step
                    machine.utilization_time += step

            # Record total time spent at this machine (includes waiting due to breakdowns)
            self.machine_times[machine.name] = self.env.now - start_time

### Event Logging Function

```python

## üîç Interpreting Simulation Results

### Understanding Bottlenecks
- A bottleneck is the resource that limits the overall system throughput
- In our simulation, it's identified as the machine with the highest utilization percentage
- Improving the bottleneck's capacity or reducing its processing time will have the greatest impact on overall system performance

### Improving Reliability
- The machine with the most failures is identified as "failure prone"
- Reducing breakdowns of this machine can significantly improve system throughput
- Real-world solutions might include preventive maintenance or equipment upgrades

### The Waiting Time Paradox
- One of the most important concepts illustrated by this simulation is how waiting times grow exponentially as utilization increases
- This explains why even systems that appear to have enough capacity (e.g., 80% utilization) can experience significant waiting times
- This principle applies to many real-world situations: factory lines, call centers, checkout lanes, and traffic systems

## üè≠ Real-World Applications

This simulation can help understand and optimize many real-world scenarios:

1. **Manufacturing**: Designing efficient production lines and identifying bottlenecks
2. **Healthcare**: Improving patient flow in hospitals and clinics
3. **Customer Service**: Optimizing staffing in call centers
4. **Logistics**: Managing warehouse operations and delivery systems
5. **Computing**: Understanding system resource allocation in servers
