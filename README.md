# Factory-Production-Line-Simulation
SimuLine is a discrete-event simulation of a multi-stage factory production line developed for the System Modeling and Simulation (CCS3003/CS305) course. The simulation models the flow of products through a series of machines with individual processing times and random failure/repair behavior.
